## Run the app locally

Install the dependencies listed in the [requirements.txt ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://pip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user_guide/#requirements-files) file to be able to run the app locally.

  ```
pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

Run the app.
  ```
python hello.py
  ```

 View your app at: http://localhost:8000

## Use the database

We're now going to update your local code to point to this database. We'll create a json file that will store the credentials for the services the application will use. This file will get used ONLY when the application is running locally. When running in IBM Cloud, the credentials will be read from the VCAP_SERVICES environment variable.

1. Create a file called `vcap-local.json` in the `get-started-python` directory with the following content:
  ```
  {
    "services": {
      "cloudantNoSQLDB": [
        {
          "credentials": {
            "username":"CLOUDANT_DATABASE_USERNAME",
            "password":"CLOUDANT_DATABASE_PASSWORD",
            "host":"CLOUDANT_DATABASE_HOST"
          },
          "label": "cloudantNoSQLDB"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
  ```
2. Replace username, password and host with correct connections
  ```
3. Run your application locally.
  ```
python hello.py
  ```

  View your app at: http://localhost:8000.
